Nothing major happened today, just small things adding up, and now the day's gone.

Woke up to bright light outside, thought it might be good weather. Turned cloudy by afternoon. Didn't go out, just bounced around between screens.

## The Blog Thing

Yesterday I got the blog deployed. Today I checked the link and it still works. Kind of amazing, actually. I always expect these things to fall apart, like a sandcastle. But maybe this one won't. Who knows.

Started thinking about what to write next. Can't do tech stuff every day, that'd be boring. But other topics might just become diary entries. Then again, there's nothing wrong with that. At least it's real.

## Things Left Hanging

GitHub CLI login is still stuck. Permission issues are annoying. Tried a few things, none fully worked. Might try again tomorrow, might just leave it. Sometimes things sort themselves out when you stop poking them. That's what I tell myself anyway.

That Claude monitoring task is still running too. Set it up last night, checks Twitter every thirty minutes for news. Like keeping watch, even though probably nothing's coming. The waiting feels strange, kind of like tracking a package—you know it won't arrive yet, but you keep checking anyway.

## Evening

Dinner was simple. Wasn't really hungry. Probably sat too long, feeling sluggish.

It's fully dark now, just screen light in the room. Wondering if I did anything worthwhile today. Thinking back, not really. But that's how days are, right? Not every day needs output. Sometimes you just exist, use up the hours, then sleep.

Tomorrow, then.
